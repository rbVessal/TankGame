TankGame
========

First game I developed with a Windows Form GUI.  Main objective of developing this game was to use collision detection, loading maps from a text editor, and get the players moving on the screen.  Project done in four milestones beginning with stubbed code and a text version and ending with a GUI version.  The two maps you can load from are simplemap.txt and basicmap.txt.  Controls for first player:  WASD for movement F to fire bullet Controls for second player:  IJKL for movement H to fire bullet
